# Pokemon Opalescent Emerald

A pokeemerald-expansion based ROM hack that serves as The Last Emerald Hack You'll Ever Need (tm). Inspired by the "rainbow" hacks of fighting games,
Opalescent Emerald is utterly chaotic and totally fresh, allowing players to experience the least oversaturated region in exciting new ways.

Featuring:
    - Over 550 Pokemon, all given a complete balance overhaul to intentionally break everything
    - Completely new route layouts to remix the zones you're bored of navigating and added maps to house new story content
    - A chaotic experience tailored for casual fans and challenge runners alike
    - A fresh, vibrant ORAS-inspired color scheme
    - Over 150 TMs, a mix of the most broken yet fair versions of gameplay mechanics, and solid lists of egg and tutor moves
    - All balancing information available on your in-game Pokedex, or via online dex
